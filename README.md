# pythonProjects
All the Practise Python Coding Questions and their solutions written by me through CS-1110 Introduction to Computer Science at UVA.

The most notable project is Forrest Run completed by a team of two as the final project. Forrest run is a multiplayer simple python game written with pygame and local UVA gamebox library. The game contains collactables, keep a score, a timer, and could be restarted once finished.
